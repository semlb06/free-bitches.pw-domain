| Parameter | Type     | Description|

| `name`      | `string` | 'name' means what comes after the slash, soif you enter '/register name: example' you get bitches.pw/example |
| `link`      | `string` | 'link' means where do you want bitches.pw/__`name`__ to point to? Example your Discord server. |
